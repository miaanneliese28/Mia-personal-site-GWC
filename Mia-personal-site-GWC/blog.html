      This is a picture of Darcy, a kitten we will be getting very soon. In fact, as soon as we get back to New York, she will be 
      waiting at the airport for us with my uncle. My sister and I are very excited since it's been 5 years since our last cat, and 
      we've never had a kitten before. She is a ragdoll

      First post! August 2, 2020.

    <p>
      Today we landed in San Diego, California. We are staying for about three weeks, which leaves us just enough time to quarantine
      in New York before school starts again. While we are here, we plan to clean out the house and get it in better shape to rent
      this coming Christmas. I will be attending a coding camp our second week here, which will last for one week.
