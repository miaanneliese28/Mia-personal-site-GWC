    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>
      My name is Mia Aklufi and I was born in raised in Manhattan, New York. I am an upcoming sophmore at The Spence School.
      I have been coding for three years and am part of the coding club at my school. I hope to pursue a career
      where I can use the programming skills I have learned, and I am excited to meet new people and learn new things. My introduction
      to coding was in my 7th grade programming class, and since then I have taken every opportunity I've been given to learn more. 
      Although it is challening at times, I enjoy problem-solving, and I hope my future career will incorporate coding in some way.
