      Let's Keep Colleges
    </h3>
    <p>
      For Kode with Klossy, we were instructed to make a website that could help create change.
      My group decided to create a website that informed people of the effects COVID-19 has had on 
      colleges and universities. To do so, we looked up statistics and analyzed data to give a 
      sense of the impact, and also linked petitions and places for people to donate.

      Personality Quiz
    </h3>
    <p>
      For the SIP with Girls who Code in 2020, we were instructed to create a Buzzfeed-inspired quiz.
      For my project, I decided to create a quiz that classify a participant as one of the four seasons
      based on their responses to questions that were asked. This quiz has five questions, each with
      four answer choices, and 5 possible results can be given (winter, spring, summer, fall, or unclear).
